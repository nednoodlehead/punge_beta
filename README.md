# punge
Punge is a completely pythonic music app that utilized pytube and SQL to download and store music. I also use Pydub to handle audio playing and crossfade.

For suggestions, ideas or to meet fellow pungers. Also i seriously doubt this will work on your system if you do not have FFMPEG installed. I should be able to bundle it with punge releases though
